                        href="https://revers.fandom.com/wiki/Revers_Team"> ReversTeam.</a> Revers initially planned to
                    feature six modpacks with their own lore, progression, gameplay, and quests, but only three were
                    completed.</p>

                    modpack in the Revers Series. It is a unpublished modpack given to the members of the now defunct <a

                        Collapse</a> is the second modpack in the Revers Series. It is a 1.12.2 modpack centered around
                    magic, technology, exploration and base-building, with integrated lore and progression.</p><br>

                <p>Reverse Collapse takes place after the events of Revers - Base, focusing on the aftermath of the
                    Foreign Deities' invasion. The player receives aid from the goddess Elisa in the form of quests and
                    currency.</p><br>

                <p>The modpack uses <a class="plain" href="https://revers.fandom.com/wiki/Revers_-_Base">Reverscore</a>
                    to interconnect progression across multiple mods. It also adds miscelaneous helpful items and bosses
                    integrated within the questline and lore.</p><br><br>
