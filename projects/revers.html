    <h1>Revers Modpack</h1>
<p>"Heaven burns red"</p>

<p>
  Revers is a series of 1.12.2 Minecraft modpacks based around some kind of story and questline.<br>
  Revers: Base is the original Revers modpack that is not available to the public. It was originally created for March break for TUC and doesn't feature any story or quests, a pack of mods.<br>
  Revers: Reverse Collapse is the main modpack of the Revers series and features relatively balanced difficulty, a myriad of quests and a small story which leaves a lot to the imagination.<br>
  Revers: Continuum Turbulence is the harder version of Reverse Collapse featuring harder increased difficulty, slightly more quests and mods.<br>
  None of these modpacks are currently supported anymore.
