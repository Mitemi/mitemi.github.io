<h2>Alternate History</h2>
<p>What is Alternate History? To first understand Alternate History, we first need to understand history. History is
  generally a collections of events that have occurred throughout humanity's lifetime. It is shaped by countless events
  and wars. However, what if things had happened differently? Alternate History is often a thought exercice to reuse the
  history learned and make it into something else. Alternate History scenarios can prove to be good settings and
  backgrounds for stories and is a niche utilisation of historical knowledge.
  However, even if most alternate history enthusiasts tend to list their works as purely works of fictions and that they
  do not contain their political beliefs nor are they trying to push an agenda onto others, we still need to be careful
  of what is fictitious alternate history and propagandist alternate history compared to the real history of mankind.
</p>

<h2>Scenarios</h2>
<p>
  Alternate History is one of my passions and hobby, one that I find both fun and useful in life. I frequently create
  alternate history scenarios and develop them further and further. Here are three of my main alternate history
  scenarios. These are not exhaustive descriptions of the entire timeline, only an abridged version as well as being
  more historic-realistic versions instead of a more story-centric version.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Etigeox</h4>
<div class="flex">
Point of Divergence - 1963/2010/2017/2027 | Present Date - 2046<br>
Etigeox is quite probably one of my most unrealistic alternate history scenarios, more so since it happens in the future
but it is my favourite. However, it wasn't created for the sake of a realistic scenario but as a background for multiple
stories I've written. Etigeox concentrates about the Etigeox Federation of Northeast America and subsequently the Etigeox ideology it bears,
its Etigeox Party and the massive fictitious company of Lysent Entertainment. The timeline spans from either 1963 or
2010 to 2127.

<h4>Manche</h4>
<div class="flex">
Point of Divergence - 1380 | Present Date - 1921<br>
Manche is an alternate history scenario based around the Victorian era and the early 20th century, mostly focusing on
the conflicts between the Angevin Empire and its newly created sister kingdom of Belgium against a Spanish-German
alliance and a Russian rivalry. Its initial point of divergence would be around 1380, with the ascension of Charles VI
to the throne of France as a child and his reign being much more terrible for France than in our timeline with a regency
council only planning to overthrow each other. Overall, the Plantagenets instead of losing most of its holdings in
France, creates an union between the Kingdoms of France and England, later absorbing Scotland into the mix. Later, as a
compromise, the capital of the new union is set on the island of Jersey in the English Channel, also known as la Manche
in French, creating a new major port city in the middle of nowhere. <br>
Elsewhere in Europe, as of 1921, the Russian Empire holds dominion over most of the east, the Kingdoms of Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania 
and Poland being under their sphere of influence. The Swedish Empire did not horribly fail as it did in 1708, however it still lost most 
of its baltic holdings to the Russians, letting the Swedes focus on a large colonial empire alongside the Dual Monarchy of the Angevin 
Empire. Spain had been united under Portugal and Castile and Leon instead of Aragon and the Holy Roman Empire had strongly united under 
effectively a dictatorship. After their defeat in the First Great War, the nations of Spain, the Netherlands and Germany had turned to 
Communism while a newly established Kingdom of Belgium was put established with the same Plantagenet Dynasty. The rest of the world in 
Manche rests divided between colonial empires, only notable exceptions being the mostly independant states of North and South America, 
a divided China, the Japanese Empire, Nejd and Iran. Oh and assassination is widespread among the<br>
aristocracy due to multiple legends depicting that succesfully killing an opposing noble with no heir would mean that
their possessions would be yours. Furthermore, Manche draws many inspirations for Divergences of Darkness, a Victoria 2 mod.

<h4>Polska Dominacja</h4>
<div class="flex">
Point of Divergence - 1200? | Present Date - 1804<br>
Polska Dominacja is an alternate history scenario mostly revolving around the Commonwealth of the Intermarium, a greater
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the United Kingdom of Hispania ruled by the House of Murcia, creating an unlikely
union between Christian and Islamic Spain. The initial two points of divergence would be during the Reconquista, where
a marriage was organized between the warring states to quell instability and the continuation and unions of the Royal Houses 
of Jagiellon and Hunyadi against the Habsburgs, Ottomans and Muscovites.<br>
The scenario mostly revolves around the betrayal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and the Netherlands against the
rest of Europe, resulting in Europe except the west ending under Polish domination.
Prior to the Seven Years War in this timeline, Europe was divided amongst a resurgent Bourbon France, Murcian Spain, the
German Confederation unifed in response of the failure of the Holy Roman Empire against outside aggression, a disunified Italy,
the Polish-Lithuanian-Hungarian Commonwealth, the Republic of Novgorod and Denmark-Norway while in the east, a collapsing Second
Assyrian Empire is facing demise facing renewed Spanish and Ottoman skirmishes.<br>
Following the disastrous Seven Years War where the United Kingdom had betrayed the rest of Europe against an overwhelming Polish Empire,
Europe is divided between the three last great powers: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and the Netherlands, also occupying France, the 
Commonwealth of the Intermarium and Murcian Spain.

<h4>FÃ¼hrerin</h4>
<div class="flex">
Point of Divergence - 1938<br>
An alternate World War Two scenario entered around an improved Molotov-Ribbentrop pact leading to a temporary
German-Soviet Alliance along with the death of Hitler and a Cold War between the Germans in Europe and Africa, Americans
in both Americas, Soviets in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and Japanese in the rest of Asia.

<p>
<h4>Fallen Afterstorm</h4>
<div class="flex">
Point of Divergence - 1910 | Present Date - 1936<br>
An alternate history scenario based around the writings of a popular French author and activist causing widespread
mutineries and revolts on the Western Front, leading to a hastened collapse of the Western Colonial Empires and
widespread unrest across Europe and the world. Civil war madness.

  Wikipedia Infobox:<br>
  While also learning HTML and CSS, I've been able to edit and recreate info boxes from Wikipedia for my alternate
  history scenarios. These are not true Wikipedia articles.

  As I am also mildly interested in vexiology, the study of flags, I have been some flags for my fictional nations for
  alternate history, often based on already existing flags.

  Countryballs:<br>
  Also known as Polandball, countryballs are a formidable way of personifying countries, nations and groups into an
  easily-digestible cute circle. I have made some Polandball comics myself based on alternate history:

<p>As an honorable mention, I did create some mapping alternate history videos on YouTube, however I do not regard them
  as professional or good enough quality to include them here.</p>
