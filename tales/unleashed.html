<p>Armageddon, Amalgation and Megidolaon.</p>
<p>
    Etigeox: Unleashed is a non-canonical tale of the Etigeox Universe set after a disastrous end to the Third Etigeox War (or World War Four).
    Nearing the Downfall, the Premier Overseer of the Etigeox Federation authorizes a devious plan to shift the tectonic plates in a last ditch
    attempt to destablize the world. The Ministry of Defence of the Federation launches several Etigeum ICBM strikes on the Eurasian Union and
    NATO, resulting in nuclear and Etigeum armageddon. The artificial lives loyal to humanity have turned their backs after being witness to mankind's
    pure madness. Ocean levels rise as climate change is definitely worsened. The ERF, nearing the end of the world decides that they might as well
    unleash an uncontrollable zombie bio-weapon upon the world.
