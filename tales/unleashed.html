    <h1>Etigeox: Unleashed</h1>
<p>Armageddon, Amalgation and Megidolaon.</p>
<p>
    Etigeox Unleashed is a "Fanfiction" written by myself set in the Etigeox Universe after a disastrous end to the Third Etigeox War (or World War Four as some might call it). Nearing the Downfall, the Premier Overseer of the Etigeox Federation began to shift the tectonic plates in a last ditch attempt to win the war. On the Ministry of Defence's end, Lise Germain authorized several Etigeum ICBM strikes on the Eurasian Union and the United States, resulting in nuclear and Etigeum armageddon. The artificial lives once loyal to the humans turned their backs to humanity after witnessing so much violence. And finally, the Etigeox Research Foundation decided that they might as well unleash an uncontrollable zombie fungus upon the world.
